## Alzheimers_DA
Alzheimer's Python Project

This is a data analysis project utilizing Python to clean, validate, perform exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, and create visualizations for the Alzheimer's data set downloaded 
from this source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alzheimers-disease-and-healthy-aging-data/resource/b2443e45-68aa-4004-b97a-e62c4c28502f. 

In this project, I showcased my knowledge of using JupytrNotebook and Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib. 

# Data Set Background
This data set originally had 250937 rows × 39 columns about healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease. 
My analysis focuses on the specific questions asked from this data set found in the 'Question' column,
with the corresponding values found in the 'Percentage' or 'Mean' column. The data was filtered for EDA and visualized based on the questions, gender, race/ethnicity, age group, and year started.
